# -Recency-Frequency-and-Monetary-value-RFM-analysis
A guided project on KMeans Clustering from a real masked data set. 

Steps taken : 
S1 : Expolratory data analysis (checking for nulls values, filtering data to see specifics) 
S2 : Cleaning the data using Regular Expression (RegEx) and isna() 
S3 : Feature Engineering to prepare the data for KMeans clustering by removing outliers as outliers negatively affect the clustering model.
S4 : Using the Elbow method in combination with silhouette analyis to choose the number of clusters.
S5 : Analysis and naming the clusters based on visualized data using violin plots.
S6 : Analyzing the outlier data 
S7 : Summary Stats using bar plots
